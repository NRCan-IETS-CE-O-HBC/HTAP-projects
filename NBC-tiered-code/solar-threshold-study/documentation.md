## Hypothesis ##

*By comparing the peak cooling loads between the proposed design and the reference house, a future code requirement can limit the likelihood that designers will use excessive solar gains to meet higher energy tiers.* 

## Method: ##

1. Using archetype homes, compare peak cooling loads for the reference house, for  the same house designed to well-known passive solar guidelines, and to worst case scenarios (E/W orientations, excessive, unshaded glazing). 

2. Propose a maximum ‘permitted increase in cooling loads’ threshold (e.g. 25%), which affords enough flexibility to design passive solar homes, but restricts ‘worst-case scenario’ homes. 

3. Verify that the threshold produces similar results across different building simulation software

4. Examine impact of the proposed metric using 240 archetypes in a variety of locations. For those that could not meet proposed requirements, identify characteristics that prevent the archetypes from meeting the requirement.
